## My process

I always start my projects form the top of the page and work my way down. In this case I started with the card and nft artwork and the hover/active state for the image. After that all that's left is the positioning and font properties of the text. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was the first time I tried to get a hover working on an image and had to retry it once because I couldn't get it quite how I wwanted it. But I figured it out and got it working.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs - I used the Mozilla Web Docs for information.
